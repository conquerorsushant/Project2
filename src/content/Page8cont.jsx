    que1: <p>What is AI/ML and how can it benefit my business?</p>,
    ans1: (
      <p>
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are a powerful
        combination that allows computers to learn from data and make
        intelligent decisions. AI/ML can benefit your business in numerous ways,
        including: Automating repetitive tasks: Free up your human workforce to
        focus on higher-level activities. Gaining deeper customer insights:
        Uncover hidden patterns and trends in your data to better understand
        your customers and personalize their experiences. Improving operational
        efficiency: Optimize your processes and workflows for increased
        productivity and cost savings. Developing innovative products and
        services: Leverage AI/ML to create cutting-edge solutions that
        differentiate you from the competition.

    que2: <p>Do I need a lot of data to develop an AI/ML model?</p>,
    ans2: (
      <p>
        The amount of data required for effective AI/ML model development can
        vary depending on the complexity of the problem you&#39;re trying to
        solve. However, with advanced techniques like transfer learning, we can
        often leverage pre-trained models and adapt them to your specific needs
        even with relatively smaller datasets.
      </p>
    ),
    que3: <p>How much does AI/ML model development cost?</p>,
    ans3: (
      <p>
        The cost of AI/ML development can vary depending on the complexity of
        the project, the amount of data involved, and the desired level of
        customization. During the discovery phase, we provide a transparent cost
        estimate tailored to your specific requirements.
